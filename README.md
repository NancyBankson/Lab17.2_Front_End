# Lab 17.2 Full Stack Deployment    

## Overview

In this lab, we created both front-end and back-end applications and connected them so that the database could be accessed and updated through the front-end URL.  Both repositories were then deployed on Render.  The URL can be accessed at https://lab17-2-front-end.onrender.com/.  The back-end is deployed here https://lab17-2-back-end.onrender.com/.

## Features

The code used for this assingment was based on Bryan's code along for Jan 28th.

## Tools

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- React

## Reflection

I had some difficulty with this assignment, but Hasna pointed out that my client origin was incorrect in my .env file.  Once that was fixed, the front-end was able to connect to the database.
